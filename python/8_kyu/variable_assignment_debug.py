# Instructions

# Variable assignment
# Fix the variables assigments so that this code stores the string 'devLab' in the variable name.

# a == "dev"
# b == "Lab"
# name ==  a + b


# Solution

a = "dev"
b = "Lab"
name = a + b


# Sample Tests

# import codewars_test as test
# from solution import a, b, name

# @test.describe('variable assignment')
# def fixed_tests():
#     @test.it('should set variable a')
#     def variable_a():
#         test.assert_equals(a, 'dev')
#     @test.it('should set variable b')
#     def variable_b():   
#         test.assert_equals(b, 'Lab')
